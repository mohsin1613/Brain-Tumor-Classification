# Brain-Tumor-Classification
We know that there are three types of brain tumors: gliomas, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. Early detection and classification of brain tumors can save the human life.
To classify the types of brain tumors from MRI images, I have employed an extended version of the EfficientNetB3 model. The accuracy of the model is 98.31%. The brain tumor classification project is developed in Python. I have also used Tensorflow, OpenCV, Neural nets and Flask for deployment.
